# Laravel Product Catalogue and Shopping Cart

This Laravel project implements a simple product catalogue and shopping cart system. Users can view a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The project includes authentication, database storage, and basic validation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mslabba/deer-test.git

2. cd deer-test
3. composer install
4. cp .env.example .env 
    Update the env file with your database credentials.  
5. php artisan migrate
6. php artisan serve
7. npm run dev


There are some improvements required. I have done this with minimum timeframe in consideration.
